<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this bootcamp is to ensure that you understand cyber technologies in order to protect their infrastructure. To do so, you need to first understand the history of cybersecurity and how we got to where we are today. Furthermore, cybersecurity is always evolving along with technology. So, it's important that you become a lifelong learner to succeed as a cybersecurity professional.</p>
<h2>Key Historical Events</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/24/03/aa/2403aa3c2780fe1eaa92d19514c08a3f--emperors-new-groove-markers.jpg" alt="Disney, Emperors new groove, Disney films" width="166" height="93"><br>Seraphina Edit: I just also wanted to bring attention to <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2012/turing-biography/" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a> who cracked the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106j/handouts/36-TheEnigmaMachine.pdf" target="_blank">Enigma Machine</a> during WWII greatly aiding the Allied Forces.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1960s</h3>
<p>The history of cybersecurity begins well before today's age of cell phones and wearable devices. In the 1960s, an experimental computer network, named Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), was created . The purpose was to let Pentagon labs share data and research through the network to military personnel in the Cold War (Featherly, 2016). The idea was that no headquarters or base of operations would exist that could be attacked and destroyed. ARPANET served as a prelude to the Internet. Today, the Internet retains a similar structure but on a larger scale.</p>
<h3>1980s</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, the first public policy related to cybersecurity was created in the early 1980s. At that time, the first laptops had barely begun distribution, and public Internet providers didn't yet exist. So, what caused this policy to be created? The answer is a movie named WarGames. This movie, which debuted in 1983, is about a teenager who hacks into the computer of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and nearly starts World War III. President Ronald Reagan attended this movie. Then, during a meeting, Reagan asked General John W. Vessey if that could happen in real life. The general determined that it could and might even be worse than what the movie depicted. So after only 15 months, Reagan signed the NSDD-145 classified national security decision directive, named <em>National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security (</em>Kaplan, 2016).</p>
<p>At first, the public didn't accept NSDD-145. It allowed the National Security Agency (NSA) to secure all the computer servers and networks in the United States. This began discussions of concern related to security and privacy on the Internet<span>—</span>a debate that still exists today.</p>
<h3>1990s</h3>
<p>In the 1990s, the Internet took off. And along with it, do did the cybersecurity industry. Virus risks increased, and companies developed antivirus programs. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was created to protect activities like online purchases. In fact, that was the foundation for the development of Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)<span>—the secure version of HTTP</span> (Education Dynamics, 2022).</p>
<h3>2000s</h3>
<p>The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 spurred conversations about how to avoid the next cyber threat. Since <span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">then, governments have weaponized vulnerabilities, and criminals have exploited them. This is an ever-growing problem because of the increase in our reliance on technology.</span></p>
<p>The 2000s also brought the first hacker group, named Anonymous. And, credit card hacks took off through data breaches. This created the need to focus on information security throughout various sectors, including retail.</p>

<h2>Cybersecurity Today</h2>
<h3>Trends and Statistics</h3>
<p>The cybersecurity field is rapidly growing. Companies are learning that they need to ramp up their security defenses against cybercriminals. With the workforce transitioning to more remote positions, and with the rise of cryptocurrency, a few trends are taking place (Sobers, 2022):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cryptocurrencies will be subject to strict regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media organizations will become stricter about how users share information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remote workers will continue to be targets for cybercriminals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cybersecurity skills gap will escalate as more jobs go unfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices will become more vulnerable to cyberattacks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Still not convinced of the need for cybersecurity? Here are a few statistics to astonish you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Human error causes 95% of cybersecurity breaches (Mee and Brandenburg, 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, the US was the target of 46% of all cyberattacks<span>—</span>more than double that of any other country (Lambert, 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of all the cyber breaches, 43% are insider threats<span>—</span>either intentional or unintentional (Check Point, 2022).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, data breaches exposed 22 billion records (Risk Based Security, 2022).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, about 40% of breaches involved phishing, 11% involved malware, and 22% involved hacking (Verizon, 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2021, 1,862 data breaches were recorded<span>—</span>surpassing the 2017 record of 1,506 breaches (Fowler, 2022).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cyber War</h3>
<p>Today, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Cyber war is a concern because it causes harm that's comparable to that of physical warfare. It does so by using technology to "disrupt the activities of a state or organization, especially the deliberate attacking of information systems for strategic or military purposes" (Oxford Languages, 2022). Seven types of cyber war attacks exist:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Espionage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sabotage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electrical power grid attacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propaganda attacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economic disruption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surprise attacks (Imperva, 2022)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We combat cyber war through risk assessments, layered defenses, and the securing of the private sector.</p>
<h3>The Business of Cybercrime</h3>
<p>Today, cybercrime can almost be considered a business. While many factors motivate cybercriminals, the main one is money. In fact, according to a 2018 Bromium report by Dr. Michael McGuire, cybercriminals generate at least $1.5 trillion per year (Polk, 2021). And, that's where you come in! Cybersecurity professionals deal with this issue in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Using a continual process:</strong> Security is lifelong and not done once. To succeed in an organization, cybersecurity must be considered a continual process. Small companies might think that they're too small to be attacked, but that's not the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Conducting security evaluations</strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><strong>:</strong> Companies need to evaluate the likelihood and impact of potential cyberattacks. This includes determining how easy of a target their systems are<span>—</span>and considering and observing what would happen if they were compromised. Lots of hidden risks can remain unnoticed. For example, the famous Target credit card breach occurred because of a <span>heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (</span>HVAC) vendor that shared the credit-card processing network (Vijayan, 2014).</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Establishing priority</strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><strong>:</strong> By multiplying the likelihood and impact, companies can establish priority. They can then change or update their systems as needed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Having a security</span></strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><strong> first mindset:</strong> Because cybercrime is such a massive business, a company needs to share its security responsibility across all its employees to succeed.</span></p>
